                        The Mad Doctor Who Rules with a Mask of Benevolence. The sign of Add’s weakness on his neck barely remains, 
                        and he is over the stage of treating and enhancing people from the countless experiments he conducted. Elrios, 
                        suffering from the demon invasion, saw new hope in the new hero and healer, but all he sees in them are test subjects. 
                        Mere chess pieces that will follow every order and will never betray him. Everything is under Add’s control. He uses the foundation he built 
                        from the research to become Overmind —
                         the ruler who leads people to the world of perfection that no one dared to enter before.
