                        As Elsword continues his journey, he came to realize that his strength just wasn't enough
                         to protect the El and his friends. He created a support equipment called "Sephira" to allow him to 
                         resonate with the El better. Unfortunately, the more he harnessed this power, the less he seemed to remember. 
                         However, Elsword decided that even if he would lose a part of himself in the process, he would not let everyone down. 
                         It was a choice he made, with a realization that everything will follow according to fate and El's will. Elsword finally 
                         transforms into a Sword of El ready to smite anyone who brings harm to the El and the people of Elrios!
